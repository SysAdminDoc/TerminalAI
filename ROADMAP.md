# TerminalAI Roadmap

Single task tracker for this repo. Newest phase at the top; completed items are removed.

## v0.3.0 — knowing what the fleet is doing

- [ ] Verify Windows toast delivery on an interactive desktop
      — *Implemented and unit-tested (which states toast, the text, dedup by session+status,
      click-to-focus via the in-process `on_activated` handler). Delivery itself was never
      observed on this machine: the app is launched onto a private desktop where notifications
      do not render, and PowerShell cannot load the WinRT projection to raise one independently.
      What is needed is one run on the interactive desktop with the Start-Menu shortcut present —
      confirm the toast appears, names the session, and that clicking it focuses that row.*

## v0.4.0 — many sessions, one operator

- [ ] Scrollback to disk with a bounded in-memory ring per session
      — *2026-08-02 research: bound in BYTES, not lines (tmux#4859 — cost scales with width, so a line limit means
      3× the memory in a wide pane). Two-tier per Warp's block model: mutable grid for the live region, packed
      immutable bytes for scrollback.*
- [ ] Git worktree per session, created and cleaned up from the launcher
      — *2026-08-02 research: git isolation alone is insufficient; see R-22 for the non-git half (ports, services,
      databases), which HN 46424131 identifies as universally unserved.*
- [ ] Broadcast a prompt to a selected set of sessions
- [ ] Cost and token rollup across the fleet
      — *2026-08-02 research: dedupe on `requestId` before summing (R-10), and pair display with enforcement (R-17).
      No OSS competitor instruments cost at all — this is the least contested feature in the survey.*
- [ ] Filter and group the list by folder, agent, status

## v0.5.0 — beyond the terminal

- [ ] ACP transport as an alternative to the pty, for a compact native chat view
      (`@zed-industries/claude-code-acp`, `agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`)
      — *2026-08-02 research: downgraded to conditional. ACP v1 is stable but neither target CLI speaks it natively;
      only third-party adapters exist. Do this only when adding a third agent family.*
- [ ] Session templates per repo, read from the repo itself

## v0.6.0 — the project factory (operator request, 2026-08-03)

- [ ] Ship default presets — the launcher's preset store starts empty; seed it with useful
      out-of-the-box presets (e.g. Claude/Codex × plan-first/full-auto × common effort levels) that
      appear on first run, are clearly marked built-in, and can be hidden or cloned but not edited
      in place
- [ ] Usability and comprehension pass — a new operator should understand the fleet screen without
      reading the README. Cover: first-run guidance beyond the empty-state card, plain-language
      labels for status/dwell/attention states, tooltips on every control, and a short in-app
      explainer of the row → focused-terminal model. Acceptance: someone unfamiliar with the tool
      can launch a session, read its state, and answer an attention request unaided
- [ ] Master project folder — register a root (e.g. `~/repos`) once; every child git repo becomes a
      known project, kept current as repos appear and disappear, and usable as a launch target
      without browsing for a folder each time (extends the v0.4.0 folder filter/grouping)
- [ ] Roadmap scanner — for every known project, detect and parse `ROADMAP.md`, surfacing
      open-item counts and staleness per project so "which projects still have work queued" is a
      glance, not a hunt
- [ ] Per-session prompt queue — queue one or more prompts against a session while it is busy;
      when the current run completes, the next queued prompt is sent automatically. Queue is
      visible and reorderable per row, a queued prompt can be edited or withdrawn before it fires,
      and completion detection uses the same hook/status signal as the fleet's Idle state — never a
      timer. If the run ends in an attention state (approval or question), the queue pauses rather
      than answering blind
- [ ] Automated roadmap work queue — stored prompt library plus a queue that runs a chosen prompt
      against all (or selected) projects whose roadmaps still have open items, one session per
      project, honoring the fleet's admission/memory budget. First two stored prompts: "research
      new roadmap items" and "drain the roadmap". Queue survives restarts, reports per-project
      outcomes, and never launches into a repo with uncommitted changes without flagging it
      (builds on v0.4.0 broadcast; distinct from it — broadcast targets running sessions, the
      queue creates them)
      — *seed the library from the operator's existing templates: `~/.claude/prompts/research-deep.txt`
      (research new roadmap items — the source of this repo's `RESEARCH.md`) and
      `~/.claude/prompts/roadmap-drain.txt` (drain the roadmap). Both are 6–11 KB of prose, so the
      store must hold multi-KB text and deliver it as a pty write, never as an argv argument or a
      shell-interpolated string — see the native-binary resolution decision in `CLAUDE.md` for why
      `cmd.exe` quoting is not an option.*
